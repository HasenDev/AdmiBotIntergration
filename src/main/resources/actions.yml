# actions.yml
# Define your custom actions here.
# The key is the action name (all lowercase) and the value is the command to run.
# Use {param} as a placeholder for the parameter. When executing the action, the parameter will replace {param}.

# Example Custom Actions:
# The following examples show how to create custom actions for the Minecraft server.

# Action: heal
# When you execute this action, it will clear the effects of the specified player (parameter).
heal: "effect clear {param}"

# Action: feed
# When you execute this action, it will give the player the saturation effect for 5 seconds (parameter).
feed: "effect give {param} minecraft:saturation 5 1 true"

# Action: broadcastcustom
# When you execute this action, it will broadcast a custom message to all players on the server.
# You can use any message as a parameter.
broadcastcustom: "say [Custom] {param}"

# How to Use:
# 1. To add a new custom action, simply define a key-value pair.
#    - Key is the action name (in lowercase).
#    - Value is the command you want to run when the action is triggered, with {param} being the placeholder for the argument.

# 2. Example command to execute:
#    - /minecraft customaction <Server Name> <Action: heal> <parameter: playername>
#    - This would run the command: effect clear playername
#    - The parameter "playername" replaces {param} in the action definition.

# IMPORTANT: Always make sure the parameter is valid for the command you're executing.
